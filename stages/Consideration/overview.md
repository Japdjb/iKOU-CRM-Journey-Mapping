# Consideration Stage – Overview

### Purpose
The Consideration stage nurtures new audiences who have shown initial interest in iKOU — such as signing up via the website, engaging with content, or browsing products — but haven’t purchased yet.  
It transforms *curiosity* into *confidence to buy* through educational, brand-building content.

### Key Automations
- **Welcome Series (Online & In-Store)** – Introduces iKOU’s values, product rituals, and wellbeing philosophy.
- **Lead Nurture (Non-Purchasers)** – Keeps subscribers engaged after Welcome if they haven’t purchased.
- **Abandoned Browse & Abandoned Cart** – Brings visitors back to complete their journey.

### Audience Segments
| Segment | Criteria | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| New Subscribers | Signed up in last 7 days | Start Welcome Series |
| Non-Purchasers | No order after Welcome | Enter Lead Nurture |
| Active Browsers | Viewed ≥1 product page | Enter Browse Flow |
| Cart Abandoners | Added to cart, no checkout | Enter Cart Flow |

### Content Strategy
The messaging at this stage centers on:
1. **Education** – Explain benefits and ingredients, not just features.  
2. **Emotional Resonance** – Use language tied to calm, ritual, and wellbeing.  
3. **Confidence Building** – Social proof, awards, reviews, sustainability.  
4. **Gentle CTAs** – Encourage exploration, not urgency.
